# Installation requirements:

  1. Create path /var/log/wpengine for the logging
  2. Create the following hierarchy, or modify the script for deployment files:
              ~/deployments
                       |---- tmp
                       |---- themes
                       |---- plugins
                       |---- wpengine
  3. Copy the gitignore file to ~/deployments/.gitignore
  4. Copy this script to ~/deployments
  5. Set permissions on script: chmod 555 ~/deployments/wpengine.sh
  6. Symlink script for execution without extension:  ln -s ~/deployments/wpengine.sh /usr/local/bin/wpengine
  7. Modify the repos array with the descriptions and *MATCH* up corresponging targets in the targets array.
  8. Clone all required themes and plugins into the ~/deployments/themes and ~/deployments/plugins folders
  9. Clone initial wpengine repositories into the path ~/deployments/wpengine/{repo name i.e staging/production}

 That is it, make sure to run the script normally without quiet mode to verify everything works as expected.
